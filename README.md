JAVA SNACK GAME

A simple and fun **Snack Game built in Java** using **Swing and AWT**.  
This project is a recreation of the classic Snake arcade game, designed to demonstrate **Java OOP principles, event handling, and GUI development**.  

---

## 🎮 Game Overview
In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen to collect food.  
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.  
- The player’s **score increases** with each successful collection.  
- The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own body.

 ## ⚙️ Features
✅ Smooth gameplay using Java Swing `Timer`  
✅ Real-time score tracking  
✅ Snake grows after eating food  
✅ Collision detection (walls & self)  
✅ Simple and responsive controls (Arrow Keys)  
✅ Lightweight and easy to run
